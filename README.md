This is simple android app to get some rectangle axis from server and draw them on screen.
I created a simple api with python to interact with it. 
you should run it on your local machine and while you running the app on emulator, it will connect to the api on localhost address.

It is a good practice about writing unit test for live data and flows. In this project I used wiremock to simulate api request inside UI tests.
